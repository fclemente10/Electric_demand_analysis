# Electric_demand_analysis
Python program to analyze the energy consumed in the electricity grid in Brazil and verify if the grids will saturate with the insertion of electric cars being charged at
different times of the day.

The Python Program reads an excel file with the electric demand of a region and asks the user how many electric cars charging in a period of the day he wants to enter and
the loads of the cars. The program generates a graph with the existing electrical demand plus the electrical load demanded by the cars. At the end the program says if the
electrical network is ready to receive the additional load or not.
